  Based on the most recent analysis or model run, produce a succinct, well-structured Markdown summary cell.
  
  The summary should include:
  - A brief reminder of what was analyzed or modeled.
  - Key quantitative metrics or performance indicators.
  - Main insights discovered.
  - Any notable limitations or caveats.
  - Suggested next steps to refine the analysis or improve the model.
  
  The tone should be professional, data-focused, and concise.
  Use headings, bullet points, or a short numbered list to keep it organized.
