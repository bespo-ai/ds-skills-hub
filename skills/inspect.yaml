description: "When using custom libraries, inspect function signatures and parameters"
content: |
  When using custom libraries, make sure you are using the correct function signature and parameters.
  If you are not sure about how to use a function, you must inspect the function and its parameters.
  Common inspection patterns:
     - help(function_name) to view docstrings
     - print(function_name.__doc__) as alternative
     - inspect.getsource(function_name) to view the source code
     - Look at the original cell where the function is defined
     - Test with simple inputs if behavior is unclear
