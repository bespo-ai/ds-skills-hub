      # Initialize OpenAI client
      client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
      
      try:
          # Call model with the given prompt
          response = client.chat.completions.create(
              model=model,
              messages=messages,
              **params
          )
          
          return response.choices[0].message.content
      except Exception as e:
