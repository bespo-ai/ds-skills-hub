## Checklist

- [ ] **Title & Description:** The title and PR description clearly summarize the changes.
- [ ] **YAML Format (for new/updated skills):**  
  - [ ] Used the recommended schema (name, mention, description, content, status, tags, etc.).
  - [ ] Skill content and instructions are clear.
  - [ ] File name uses lower-case and hyphens (e.g., `my-new-skill.yaml`).
  - [ ] Status is set to `inactive` or `active`. Active skills are automatically retrieved when relevant to the user's request so they should be used sparingly. Most skills should be inactive.
- [ ] **Testing:** Confirmed the skill or changes work as intended (if possible). Best practice is to test the skill in a local environment and share a video or screenshot.
